## List of things to :
- add collaboration. Toads could know what section of the game board other toads are in. Toads could go towards other toads if they were really lost and another toad is really close.
- add timer. We need to see how much longer the simulation will run. make this modular.
- add option to turn off output graphics. This will let us run a bunch of simulations.
- auto scrpting the running of simulations.
- think about poster & presentation

## Who is doing what
