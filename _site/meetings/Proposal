The layout of the game is one player plays as Mario, and after a head start must remain untouched and manage to stay away from the four other players, who play as Toads. This game is what we will be focusing on solving.
	Stripping the fancy elements of the game, the multiple elevations and power ups, we will focus on an algorithm for the Toads to be successful in capturing Mario on a field that is not limitless and win the game. Using the Python module matplotlib we will be able to simulate the chase and construct a Greedy algorithm to ensure the success of the Toads.
	In conclusion, after meeting with the Professor for office hours and receiving an enthusiastic yes this team is ready to play, solve, and overcome Mario Chase.
