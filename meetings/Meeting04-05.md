# Meeting April 5th.

## matplotlib
 
- we should consider not letting toads occupy the same coordinate.

## Things we are not accounting for
- time
- collisions
- obsticles

## List of features to add:
- collisions
  A basic collision function that can check if somthing is in the way when the toad is trying to move.
- obsticles
  we need to add the obsticles into the game. Andrew will handle this.
- mario algrithm
- add special states (tiles that slow you down. Tiles that slide you to the bottom of a hill.)
- add tackle mechanic (percentage of time when you are close to mario if you can tackle him) Jump feature.
- add collaboration. Toads could know what section of the game board other toads are in. Toads could go towards other toads if they were really lost and another toad is really close.
  
## Who is doing what
 - matplotlib: Lee will handle this.
 - collisions and obsticles: andrew will add these to the model.
 - modify toad ai to account for walls. Andrew will do this.
 
**All tasks need to be complete by next monday. **
